# WymaTimesheetWebApp
“Wyma”, an Engineering company in Hornby has contacted our class in respect to a Project ripe for a Scholarship program. It will be an app for android and potentially IOS that will help the people in their factory, sign into the premises without having to manually input their data onto one singular computer at the start and the end of the day. They previously have had issues with using manual timesheets in a Job Costing Software and have recently implemented a system that works on (mostly for design engineers) for the use on Local PCs. But the biggest issue is for the people on the main factory floor who don’t have access to a PC and are still stuck manually signing in at a single sign in point. This is where we can come in. I believe we can create an android app that will allow the people working on the factory floor to sign in from anywhere on the premises, ultimately removing the bottleneck of signing from one point, improving work effectiveness and making sure everyone can get to work as soon as they arrive on the premises.
